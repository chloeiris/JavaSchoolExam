This is the solution I'm sending for the level test for Java School at T-Systems.

I have used Python and then Java to solve the first task, the Calculator, you can see it here: https://github.com/chloeiris/JavaSchoolExam/tree/main/src/main/java/com/tsystems/javaschool/tasks/calculator

It was the first time I programed in Java, which was quite a challenge, but I started to become familiar with it by solving this task!

Thanks for the challenge,
Chloe
